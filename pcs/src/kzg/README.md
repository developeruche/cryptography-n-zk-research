KZG Polynomial Commitment Scheme
-----------------------------------


This section of this research repo is focused on the KZG Polynomial Commitment Scheme (PCS).
<br />
The KZG Polynomial Commitment Scheme is a cryptographic primitive that allows a prover to commit to a polynomial and later prove that the commitment is well-formed. 
The KZG PCS is used in various cryptographic protocols, including zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable delay functions, and succinct arguments. This section will cover the basics of the KZG PCS, 
including the definitions, constructions, and applications of the KZG PCS.

### Implemeation Focus
The implementation focus of this section is on the following KZG PCS:
1. Univariate KZG10 Polynomial Commitment Scheme
2. Multilinear KZG10 Polynomial Commitment Scheme
