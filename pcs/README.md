# Polynomial Commitment Schemes
---------------------------------

This section of this research repo is focused on Polynomial Commitment Schemes (PCS). 
PCS are cryptographic primitives that allow a prover to commit to a polynomial and later prove that the commitment is well-formed. 
PCS are used in various cryptographic protocols, including zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable delay functions, and succinct arguments. 
This section will cover the basics of PCS, including the definitions, constructions, and applications of PCS.


### Implemeation Focus
The implementation focus of this section is on the following PCS:
1. KZG10 Polynomial Commitment Scheme (Univariate and Multilinear)
2. FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof) for Polynomial Commitment
3. IPA (Inner Product Argument) for Polynomial Commitment
