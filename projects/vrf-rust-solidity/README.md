This is a implementation of an Verifiable random function oracle, providing randomness onchain to dapps. The Oracle is a rust base HTTP server that listens for randomness request and provide the need random data. this project also houses the contract that makes this randomness accessible to dapps. 

Lastly, for test purpose, a lottery game has been created using the Oracle as a source of randomness.
