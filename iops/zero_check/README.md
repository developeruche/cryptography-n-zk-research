# Zero Check Protocol

The ZeroCheck PIOP (Polynomial Interactive Oracle Protocol) is a subprotocol used in zero-knowledge proof systems to verify that a polynomial evaluates to zero over a specific domain. It is a critical building block in many zero-knowledge proof systems, particularly in protocols like Plonk, to check consistency or enforce certain constraints.
