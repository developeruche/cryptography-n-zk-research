# Sumcheck 201 Playground

This section of this research repo is focused on experimenting with the Sumcheck201 algorithm. most of the codes for this crate is copied from ingoyama's implementation. Using the crate to find out which of the sum check's implementation is more efficient (space and time). But time complexity is most important to me. From benches, algorithm one shows to be `30x` faster than algorithm 2. 

I am also using this crate to understand the developers approach to implementing the sumcheck201 algorithms, more like picking their brains :)


I hope with this few points of mine, I have been able to convince and not confuse you, you should not use this code for an thing looking like a production environment!!
