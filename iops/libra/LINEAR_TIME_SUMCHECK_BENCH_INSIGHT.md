## Summary of Benchmark Results

1. **Basic Performance Comparison**:
   - Traditional SumCheck (prove): ~7.45 µs
   - Traditional SumCheck (verify): ~4.38 µs
   - Linear Time SumCheck (prove): ~5.01 µs
   - Linear Time SumCheck (verify): ~3.09 µs

   For the basic test case, the Linear Time SumCheck is faster than the Traditional SumCheck for both proving and verification.

2. **Scaling Performance**:
   - For small inputs (size 2), Traditional SumCheck (~1.31 µs) is faster than Linear Time SumCheck (~2.64 µs)
   - As the size increases, both implementations show increased execution time, but with different scaling behaviors:
     - Size 4: Traditional (~4.42 µs) vs Linear Time (~8.25 µs)
     - Size 8: Traditional (~38.47 µs) vs Linear Time (~65.77 µs)
     - Size 16: Traditional (~8.49 ms) vs Linear Time (~13.57 ms)

3. **Throughput Analysis**:
   - The benchmark also includes throughput measurements (elements processed per second)
   - For size 16, Traditional achieves ~1.88 Kelem/s vs Linear Time's ~1.18 Kelem/s

### Key Insights

1. **Basic Performance**: In the specific test case from the test module (which involves a specific polynomial setup), the Linear Time SumCheck implementation is approximately 33% faster for proving and 30% faster for verification.

2. **Scaling Behavior**: Interestingly, when we benchmark with varying input sizes, the Traditional SumCheck implementation seems to perform better. This might be due to:
   - The specific nature of the test polynomials (which may favor the traditional approach)
   - Overhead in the Linear Time implementation that becomes more significant with smaller inputs
   - Different optimization characteristics of the two implementations

3. **Large Input Performance**: For the largest input size tested (16), both implementations show significant time increases, but the Traditional approach maintains a performance advantage.
