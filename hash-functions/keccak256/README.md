# RustKeccak256 Hash Function Implementation

A Rust implementation of the Keccak-256 hash function, which is widely used in blockchain technology and cryptographic applications.

## Overview

Keccak-256 is a specific variant of the Keccak hash function family that was selected as the winner of the SHA-3 competition. This implementation focuses on the variant used in Ethereum and other blockchain platforms.

## Goal
The Goal of the Implementation is to understand the Keccak256 hash function in depth so I could implement circuit constraints of the Keccak256 hash function.
This would be handy for benchmarking proof systems
