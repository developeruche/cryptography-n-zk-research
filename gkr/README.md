The GKR protocol is very fascinating, fairly not so complicated compared to other protocols but heavily generic and useful. The GKR protocol involves running one protocol (Sum check) inside this protocol (GKR). The GKR protocol, named after Shafi Goldwasser, Yael Tauman Kalai, and Guy N. Rothblum, is a zero-knowledge proof protocol that focuses on efficient delegation of computation. Specifically, it is designed to verify computations represented as layered arithmetic circuits with logarithmic depth in the number of inputs. The GKR protocol is known for its efficiency and ability to handle large-scale computations.
