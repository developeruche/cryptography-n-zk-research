## Interactive Chaum Pederson zero-knowledge proof
The Chaum-Pedersen Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocol allows a prover to convince a verifier that they possess a secret value (knowledge) without revealing the actual value itself. It operates in an interactive setting, meaning the prover and verifier exchange messages back and forth.

**Features**
- [x] Interactive proof generation and verification.

**Features**
- [x] Non-interactive proof generation
- [x] Non-interactive proof verification

## Polynomial
This is the implementation of a polynomial in Rust. The Polynomial struct allows you to create a polynomial, evaluate it at a specific point, and add or multiply two polynomials together.

The variations of polynomials built in here are;
- Univariate Polynomial
- Multivariate Polynomial
- Multilinear Polynomial

... the last two could give a man 2^N complexity nightmare :).

The GKR protocol is fascinating, fairly not as complicated as other protocols but heavily generic and useful. The GKR protocol involves running one protocol (Sum check) inside this protocol (GKR). The GKR protocol, named after Shafi Goldwasser, Yael Tauman Kalai, and Guy N. Rothblum, is a zero-knowledge proof protocol that focuses on efficient delegation of computation. Specifically, it is designed to verify computations represented as layered arithmetic circuits with logarithmic depth in the number of inputs. The GKR protocol is known for its efficiency and ability to handle large-scale computations.
